## About

Hello, my name is Vig Vishwanathan. I am a music producer and composer based out of the NJ and MD area, 
but I am also a data analyst and budding web designer.

So, I decided to build a digital portfolio of all my work: placements, sample packs, and beats.

My placements, under the *DISCOGRAPHY* column, are all my productions thus far (from most recent to earliest), and will be updated as time goes on.
Each "card" is an album I've worked on, and in the instances that there are multiple songs per album, those cards each have their own "screens" per song.
The information includes track titles, album names, primary (and additional) artists, as well as links to Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, and SoundCloud (wherever applicable).

My sample packs, under the *SOUND KITS* column, are my current sample packs for sale.
The information here includes YouTube links to preview, as well as purchase links that take you to my DropBox Shop.

Lastly, up top I have links to my various social media accounts: Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok; as well as my email, and a link to listen to my beats on the OffTop platform.

-Vig
